## Simple Carbonara

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb spaghetti
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup romano/parmesan cheese (grated)
* Handful of parsley (chopped)
* 4 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
* 8 oz bacon/pancetta/thick cut bacon (cut into bits)

#### Directions

Boil spaghetti in a large pot with a dash of salt until al dente.  Drain pasta, keep 1/2 cup of water for sauce (optional).  Whisk 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of romano/parmesan cheese together, add parsley (can be done while pasta is cooking).  Saute bacon until crispy/fat is rendered.  Add garlic and saute until softened.  Toss pasta in bacon and coat in oil, heating pasta if needed (you will want the pasta hot enough to cook the eggs into a sauce).  Remove from heat, add egg/cheese mix to pasta and toss/mix well to keeps eggs from scrambling.  The heat of the pasta will cook the eggs, add pasta water as desired to thin out the sauce.  Use remaining 1/2 cup of cheese as topping, add salt and pepper to taste.

Serves 4-6
